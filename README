Description
===========

This is an equivalent for windows of the tool jstest.
Unfortunately, it does not support axes 2 to 5 currently.

Usage

Install jstest.exe to a directory.
Launch a command prompt via:
Windows+r, then enter "cmd".
This will open a command line window.
Then type "dir C:\install\folder"
Where C:\install\folder is the folder where you saved the exe.
